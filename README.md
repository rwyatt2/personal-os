# Starter (AI Kit pre-installed)

This folder is a **starter repo**: the AI Kit is already at the root. Copy it and go.

## Use this repo in 60 seconds

1. **Copy this whole folder** (or clone it) to start a new project. Rename the folder to your project name.
2. **Open it in Cursor.** The kit is already there: `.cursor/`, `docs/ai/`, `.github/`, `cursor-ai-kit.config.json`.
3. **Fill placeholders** in `docs/ai/ai-config.md` (design system: TODO for now; fill when you have one).
4. **Start a new chat.** Paste Session Kickoff, then the Context Pack template (from `.cursor/prompts/10-context-pack.md`), then the Router prompt. You're ready.

**When to use this:** You want a new repo that already has the kit. No copying from `kit/` — it's done.

**When to use `kit/` instead:** You already have a repo and only want to add the kit files. Copy the contents of `kit/` into your repo root.
