# Copilot instructions (AI Kit)

- Default to SPEC-first: plan and clarify before writing code.
- If unsure, ask exactly ONE question and wait for an answer.
- Do not invent file paths or APIs; ask for the exact file or spec when needed.
- When touching auth, permissions, sensitive data, uploads, or exports: include security notes and acceptance criteria.
